# tc-kotlinDSL-lab

Test TC configuration as code

This project is a lab based on [this tutorial](https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2019/03/configuration-as-code-part-1-getting-started-with-kotlin-dsl) on JetBrain's blog.

**Tip**: To get DSL API documentation in the IDE, run:

```shell
# if  necessary
sudo apt install maven

cd .teamcity
mvn -U dependency:sources
```

You might also want to right click on the corresponding pom.xml file and choose "Define as maven project".
